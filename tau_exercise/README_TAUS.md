# Tau README

Next steps:
- Produce efficiency and isolation plots, also for the cut-based approach.

## Plotting tau variables
Use `tau_exercise/plot_tau_features/runValidationPlots.C`.

## Plotting efficiency for selecting gen-level tau
Use `tau_exercise/files/cutBased/runIso.C`. The input file is a `dyll.root`, because it is just plotting the efficiency to select a gen-level tau.

- `runIso.C` should be on a SL7 machine.
